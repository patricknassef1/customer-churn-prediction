# customer-churn-prediction
This project predicts whether a bank customer will leave the bank (churn) using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) built with TensorFlow/Keras.
The dataset contains information such as geography, credit score, age, balance, and more.
The goal is to help banks identify at-risk customers and take action to improve retention.
ðŸ“Š Dataset

# ðŸ“ˆ Results

Accuracy on Test Set: ~XX% (replace with your actual test accuracy)

Confusion Matrix shows the distribution of correct vs. incorrect predictions.

ðŸ”® Single Prediction Example

You can predict a single customerâ€™s churn probability using:

ann.predict(sc.transform([[1, 0, 0, 600, 1, 40, 3, 60000, 2, 1, 1, 50000]])) > 0.5


This example predicts whether a 40-year-old male customer in France with specific account details will leave the bank.
